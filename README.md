# Tetris-game
Tetris is a well-common game where you have to place blocks (called Tetrominoes) in a right way to fill up one line
of the grid or more.
My tetris-game is a simplified version of the original tetris game.

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m1rels/tetris-game
   ```

2. In VS Code go to index.html, right-click and choose "Open with Live Server". You should see the game popping up in your browser.
